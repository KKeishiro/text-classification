## Overview

- This is a text classification (sentence classification) problem.
- Datasets that are used here are [Reuters Newswire Topics and IMDB Movie reviews.](https://keras.io/datasets/)
- The model were built with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Word Embeddings on Tensorflow or Keras.
